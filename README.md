Python script to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance
to different cities in the US given a set of distances between some cities
(in arbitrary units).
When given the (optional) destination, it prints out only the shortest path
from the given source to destination; otherwise it prints out shortest
paths from source to all cities.
